# Medical Image Processing - Final Assignment

This repository contains the final assignment for the **Medical Image Processing** course. The main focus is on loading and visualizing DICOM images, as well as performing basic 3D image segmentation.

**Note** The `notebooks` directory include old files used to explore headers and try loading and visualization techniques. Do not take it into account.

## Features

- DICOM image loading using `pydicom` and header exploration
- Visualization of 2D slices and 3D volumes
- Basic 3D segmentation using Region Growing
- Animations can be found in `results` folder

## Technologies Used

- Python
- [pydicom](https://pydicom.github.io/)

## Usage

To explore the main content of the project:

1. Clone the repository
